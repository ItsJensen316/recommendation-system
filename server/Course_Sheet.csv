The need for distributed computation on private data arises in several real-world applications that require computations involving sensitive data from two or more mutually distrusting entities. Consider the following example, which is one of the latest applications of secure computation:  The Earth is orbited by thousands of man-made satellites and several thousands of orbital debris. The growing number of satellites and space debris orbiting the planet increases the danger of collisions. And this is not a hypothetical scenario, as several such “high-profile” collisions have been reported in the recent past. Given the expensive cost of satellites, the host countries would like to avoid collision. A collision can only be predicted if the detailed orbit information of the individual satellites is known.  However, such information can be highly sensitive and in fact, it can even be a national secret.  So, what is needed here is a way to determine whether two satellites are about to clash with each other based on the detailed locations of the satellites, but without the need of disclosing the locations of the satellites to other host countries. Secure MPC models the above and several such applications that make simultaneous demands for the privacy and usability of sensitive data. Other examples include secure e-voting, secure e-auction, secure signal-processing, secure bioinformatics, secure biometrics, secure machine-learning, secure outsourcing, privacy-preserving data mining, to name a few."

Problem solving in artificial intelligence (AI) is inspired from these diverse approaches. AI problem solvers may be based on search, on memory, or on knowledge representation and reasoning. An approach to problem solving is to pose problems as constraint satisfaction problems (CSP), and employ general methods to solve them. The task of a user then is only to pose a problem as a CSP, and then call an off-the-shelf solver. CSPs are amenable to combining search based methods with reasoning. In this 2 credit course we will look at general approaches to solving finite domain CSPs, and explore how search can be combined with constraint propagation to find solutions.

Further, C Programming Language Family (C, C++, C#, Objective C etc.) dominate more than 25% of activities. Hence, learning C++ is important as one learns about the entire family, about Object-Oriented Programming and gets a solid foundation to also migrate to Java and Python as needed. C++ is the mother of most general purpose of languages. It is multi-paradigm encompassing procedural, object-oriented, generic, and even functional programming. C++ has primarily been the systems language till C++03 which punches efficiency of the code with the efficacy of OOP. Then, why should I learn it if my primary focus is on applications? This is where the recent updates of C++, namely, C++11 and several later offer excellent depths and flexibility for C++ that no language can match. These extensions attempt to alleviate some of the long-standing shortcomings for C++ including porous resource management, error-prone pointer handling, expression semantics, and better readability. The present course builds up on the knowledge of C programming and basic data structure (array, list, stack, queue etc.) to create a strong familiarity with C++98 / C++03. Besides the constructs, syntax and semantics of C++ (over C), we also focus on various idioms of C++ and attempt to go to depth with every C++ feature justifying and illustrating them with several examples and assignment problems.
